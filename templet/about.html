        <h1 class="h1s">About Us</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to Odelice Pizzeria, where passion meets flavor in every slice!</h2>
        <h4 class="h4s">At Odelice Pizzeria, we believe that great pizza is an art form. Founded by a group of pizza enthusiasts, 
            our mission is to bring the authentic taste of Italy to your neighborhood. 
            From the bustling streets of Naples to the cozy corners of New York, 
            our pizzas are inspired by traditional recipes and modern culinary techniques.</h3>
            
        <h1 class="h1s"> Our Story</h1>
        <h4 class="h4s">Our journey began with a simple love for pizza and a dream to create a place where everyone could enjoy a perfect 
            slice. We started as a small, family-owned pizzeria, dedicated to using only the freshest ingredients 
            and time-honored methods. Over the years, our commitment to quality and authenticity has helped us grow,
             but our core values remain the same.</h4>   
            
            
        <h1 class="h1s"> Our Ingredients</h1>
        <h4 class="h4s">We take pride in sourcing the finest ingredients for our pizzas. 
            From farm-fresh vegetables to premium cheeses and meats, 
            every component of our pizzas is carefully selected to ensure the highest quality.
             Our dough is made fresh daily, hand-stretched, and baked to perfection in our stone
              ovens. The result is a crispy, flavorful crust that serves as the perfect base for our delicious toppings.</h4>  
            
            
        <h1 class="h1s"> Our Menu</h1>
        <h4 class="h4s">            Our menu offers a wide variety of options to suit every palate. Whether you're a fan of classic Margherita, crave the bold flavors of a Meat Lovers, or prefer a gourmet option like our Truffle Mushroom, we have something for everyone. We also offer gluten-free and vegan options, so everyone can enjoy a slice of Odelice.
